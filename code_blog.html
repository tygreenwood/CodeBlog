                Going into this project, I had a little bit of background on HTML. Primarily, this background was related to 
                syntax and generic structure. Like the fact that you have headers and paragraphs, and everything appears in the 
                order that it is coded in. What I didn't know as well was the more technical elements, like how to link other 
                pages, or what some of the differences between elements were. Overall, I felt that the assignment wasn't too 
                difficult, and the most trouble I had was figuring out how to actually publish the pages to the internet via 
                the engineering servers. I pretty much was able to figure everything out based on the information I got from 
                lectures, the one external resource I used was the Oregon State page on how to publish pages to the engineering 
                server.

                This assignment, when it started as only HTML, was a little overwhelming to begin. My brain was struggling a
                little to make the website look like the mocks. However, once it game together, it felt very satisfying. I
                found that breaking this down into smaller pieces was the easiest way to do this assignment. I started by formatting
                the header, and then the filter sidebar, and lastly the main section, the posts. One of the most useful resources
                for me was A Complete Guide to Flexboxes, by css-tricks.com. Flexboxes were very useful for laying out my page,
                and a lot of the formatting for this assignment was done using them. While I learned a lot of good CSS from this
                assignment, I think the most valuable thing I learned was how to tackle the task of applying CSS to a webpage.

                This was one of the easier assignments for me so far, since Javascript has a lot of similarities to other
                code languages that I'm used to, like Java and C++. Since I have a lot of experience in those kinds of
                languages, Javascript was pretty easy to learn. The hardest part of this assignment was making sure that the 
                new posts that were added were able to filtered, just like posts that had already been there. The extra credit 
                section was not really difficult, since all I needed to do was add a small section of code that compared an entered
                city to the current list of cities, and added a small bit of HTML if there was no match.

                At first, I struggled a lot with this assignment, and I went about doing it in a poor way. I tried to read in all
                the files and then stick them all in the html file using script and style elements. This caused a lot of errors and
                didn't load everything properly. I then realized that the way I was supposed to do this was load everything into
                their own webpage, under their own content type. Doing this immediately made all my code work, and made what seemed
                like a daunting task (since I basically thought I still had tons of errors and hours worth of work in front of me),
                a brief, ten minute fix instead.

                This may have been the trickiest assignment for me. The actual templatizing of the html was not tricky, as it was
                basically copying over the html and replacing sections with variables. The hard part of the assignment was figuring
                out how to run everything in the express server. Certain functions and lines of code shown in the lecture notes
                didn't work, such as "var exphbs = require('express-handlebars')". In fact, the only way I got it to work was to 
                deconstruct that library and get the engine function from it, "const { engine } = require('express-handlebars')".
                Besides that, everything else went fairly smooth.
