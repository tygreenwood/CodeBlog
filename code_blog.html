                Going into this project, I had a little bit of background on HTML. Primarily, this background was related to <br>
                syntax and generic structure. Like the fact that you have headers and paragraphs, and everything appears in the <br>
                order that it is coded in. What I didn't know as well was the more technical elements, like how to link other <br>
                pages, or what some of the differences between elements were. Overall, I felt that the assignment wasn't too <br>
                difficult, and the most trouble I had was figuring out how to actually publish the pages to the internet via <br>
                the engineering servers. I pretty much was able to figure everything out based on the information I got from <br>
                lectures, the one external resource I used was the Oregon State page on how to publish pages to the engineering <br>
                server.
