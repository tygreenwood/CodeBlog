                Going into this project, I had a little bit of background on HTML. Primarily, this background was related to 
                syntax and generic structure. Like the fact that you have headers and paragraphs, and everything appears in the 
                order that it is coded in. What I didn't know as well was the more technical elements, like how to link other 
                pages, or what some of the differences between elements were. Overall, I felt that the assignment wasn't too 
                difficult, and the most trouble I had was figuring out how to actually publish the pages to the internet via 
                the engineering servers. I pretty much was able to figure everything out based on the information I got from 
                lectures, the one external resource I used was the Oregon State page on how to publish pages to the engineering 
                server.

                This assignment, when it started as only HTML, was a little overwhelming to begin. My brain was struggling a
                little to make the website look like the mocks. However, once it game together, it felt very satisfying. I
                found that breaking this down into smaller pieces was the easiest way to do this assignment. I started by formatting
                the header, and then the filter sidebar, and lastly the main section, the posts. One of the most useful resources
                for me was A Complete Guide to Flexboxes, by css-tricks.com. Flexboxes were very useful for laying out my page,
                and a lot of the formatting for this assignment was done using them. While I learned a lot of good CSS from this
                assignment, I think the most valuable thing I learned was how to tackle the task of applying CSS to a webpage.
